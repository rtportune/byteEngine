COMPONENTS

- Components handle specialized tasks related to their type.
- Components have specialized data related to their type.
- By combining components together into groups, "entities" can be represented with different properties
- Components know who their parent Entity is, therefore they can obtain related component references.

ENTITIES

- Entities are collections of components.
- Entities do not know what their constituent components are and serve only as a means to determine relation between
sets of components
- If there are multiple copies of a particular entity present at one time, some of their components may refer to 
"duplicate" data - in the case of meshes for example. In this case, the component manager will need to be intelligent
about storing internal data that is common vs that is unique.

SYSTEMS

- Systems are in charge of a particular type of Component.
- Systems perform operations on the Components they handle. 


- Anything that is rendered on the screen is taken to be a part of a "Scene"

SCENES

- Can probably be represented using Entities, though maybe they should be their own type?
- Contain a list of all components required for the scene, but is not a static data structure - other
components/entities can be created and added to the scene.
- Contain a list of how the components are grouped together within entities.
